# cling-helper
A collection of C++ scripts for the Cling interpreter. The scripts provide easy access to internal information of the Cling. The main purpose is the development and debugging of the Cling.

# Experimental Functions

Scripts on this branch only work completely with my fork of [cling](https://github.com/SimeonEhrig/cling). It is also possible that some functions will work with the official development branch of cling when my changes are committed. If one of my changes becomes part of a release of cling, I will move the script/function to the main branch.

# Usage

The scripts are designed to be used independently. `#include` the scripts in Cling and run the functions.
